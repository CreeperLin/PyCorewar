README for the Bogus Benchmark for PyCorewar

WARNING! Do not expect the benchmark to return useful results. You have been
warned! ;-)

You need at least Python (>= 2.3) and PyCorewar (>= 0.2.0) to run the
benchmark. If you want to compare the results to other MARS, you will need
executables of theses MARS, too. At the moment pMARS, exmars, exhaust and
exhaust-ma are supported.

The benchmark for '94nop consists of 50 fights. You can specify how many
rounds each fight should run. At the moment only 100, 1000, 2500, 5000
and 10000 are accepted number of rounds. Expected the benchmark to take
a lot of time, if you specify 5000 or even 10000 rounds. Use the "-r"
switch to specify the number of rounds.

To get a short help on the usage of the benchmark, type "./benchmark -h"
on the command line.

To benchmark PyCorewar, type "./benchmark -r 1000".

If you want to benchmark pMARS, you need the server version of pMARS.
Type "./benchmark -r 1000 -m pmars -p /path/to/pmars_server" to run the
benchmark.

If you want to benchmark exmars, you need the exmars executable. Type
"./benchmark -r 1000 -m exmars -p /path/to/exmars" to run the benchmark.
