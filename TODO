TODO for PyCorewar

- Change Corewar.Parser to parse even more warriors
- Create Corewar.SimpleParser to parse warriors (in simplified format)
- Create Corewar.Benchmarking.MARS94
- Adjust pymars to included currently supported features.
- Extend benchmark (more warriors, different hills).
- Add routines for benchmarking warriors, similar to 

      benchmark(warrior1, (opponent1, opponent2, opponent3))
